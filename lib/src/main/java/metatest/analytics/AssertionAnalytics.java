/**
 * AssertionAnalytics - Analyzes quality and effectiveness of test assertions
 *
 * Planned features:
 * - Calculate Assertion Quality Score (AQS)
 * - Detect weak assertions (status code only vs full validation)
 * - Identify missing assertions for critical fields
 * - Suggest assertion improvements based on API contract
 * - Correlate assertion quality with fault detection rate
 *
 * Metrics:
 * - Tier 0: No assertions (just API calls)
 * - Tier 1: Status code only
 * - Tier 2: Status + schema validation
 * - Tier 3: Status + schema + business logic
 * - Tier 4: Full contract + state verification
 *
 * TODO: Implement in future iteration
