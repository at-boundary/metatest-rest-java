# Gotchas

Recurrent traps in Antigen development and their fixes. Format: **Symptom → Cause → Fix**.

## `./gradlew clean` fails: "Unable to delete directory ... output.bin ... a process has files open"

- **Symptom:** `clean` (or `clean test`) fails on Windows complaining a file under `build/` is locked.
- **Cause:** a live Gradle daemon holds test-result files open.
- **Fix:** run `./gradlew --stop` before any `clean`. Always, on Windows.

## Every simulated fault is "caught" (or escaped) — the report is uniform

- **Symptom:** the fault report shows ~100% caught (or ~100% escaped); `caught_by[].error`
  contains `cannot be cast` (`BasicHttpResponse`→`CloseableHttpResponse`) or `no content-type`.
- **Cause:** the simulation re-run in `AspectExecutor.interceptApacheHttpClient` returned a
  response that callers (RestAssured) couldn't use — wrong type, or no `Content-Type` so there
  was no parser. The exception surfaced as a false "caught" for *every* fault.
- **Fix:** the synthetic re-run response must be a `CloseableHttpResponse` **and** carry the
  original `Content-Type` (default `application/json`). See
  `src/main/java/io/antigen/core/interceptor/AspectExecutor.java`. Always health-check the
  report (see the `test-e2e` skill) — a green build does not mean a valid report.

## A value invariant escapes even though the test asserts the field

- **Symptom:** an invariant like `price >= 0` escapes although the test checks `price`.
- **Cause:** monetary fields (`price`, `cash_balance`, `total_value`, `current_price`) are JSON
  **strings** (`"150.00"`), but `ViolationGenerator` injects a **number** (`0.0`/`-1.0`) to
  violate `>0`/`>=0`. A `notNullValue()` / `not(emptyString())` assertion passes on a number.
- **Fix:** assert the field stays a string — `body("price", instanceOf(String.class))` fails
  the moment the value becomes a number, catching both the negative and zero-boundary mutation.

## Cross-field / temporal invariants always escape

- **Symptom:** invariants like `created_at <= updated_at` or `created_at <= $.filled_at` never
  get caught.
- **Cause:** RestAssured (and most assertion libraries) can't express a *relational* assertion
  between two response fields, so a typical suite genuinely can't catch these.
- **Fix:** this is expected, not a bug. These belong in the "uncatchable" bucket when reasoning
  about a target escape rate (~15–20% for the demoapi suite is healthy).

## Nested-field invariants cross-contaminate the report (false catches)

- **Symptom:** invariants on **nested** fields (`subscription.plan`, `metadata.loginCount`,
  `paymentMethod.card.last4`) show up as *caught* when they shouldn't, and `caught_by[].error`
  names a **different** invariant's mutation (e.g. `user_username_present` "caught" with
  `expected <dark> but was <INVALID_VALUE>`, which is the *theme* mutation). Order-dependent;
  worse with many invariants on one endpoint.
- **Cause:** `FaultPlanner.mutatedBody` copied the baseline response with a **shallow**
  `new LinkedHashMap<>(responseMap)`. The top level is fresh but nested maps/lists are shared with
  the baseline, so `applyMutation` descending into `subscription` → `put("plan", …)` mutates the
  *shared* nested object — corrupting the baseline and leaking into every later fault run. Top-level
  mutations (`status`, `quantity`) never exposed it, which is why the trading/demoapi suite (all
  top-level) looked fine.
- **Fix:** deep-copy the response before mutating (`FaultPlanner.deepCopy` / `deepCopyValue`,
  recursive over maps+lists, scalars shared). Keep `LinkedHashMap`/`ArrayList` so field order stays
  byte-stable for the conformance vectors. Confirmed: conformance unchanged, demoapi held 39/33/6.

## Foreign adapter: per-test-file engine spawn → split/overwritten report (Jest)

- **Symptom:** running the TS adapter over multiple test files yields a report covering only the
  *last* file (or N separate reports), even though every file ran faults.
- **Cause:** Jest sandboxes each test file's module registry, so a module-level singleton (the
  `FaultSimulator` / its `EngineClient`) is re-created per file. A per-file spawn means one engine
  process and one `session/end` (→ one `build/antigen/fault_simulation_report.json`, fixed path)
  per file — last write wins.
- **Fix:** one engine + **one session for the whole run**. Spawn the engine once in Jest
  `globalSetup` (HTTP transport, shared port), hand the `{port, sessionId}` to per-worker
  simulators on disk (`engine-session.json`), and call `session/end` once in `globalTeardown`. Run
  `maxWorkers: 1` so the shared session is scored serially (architecture §8). stdio's
  one-process-pipe model can't span Jest workers — use HTTP here.

## Foreign adapter: spawned engine keeps the test runner alive (won't exit)

- **Symptom:** "Jest did not exit one second after the test run has completed"; a `java` process
  lingers after the run.
- **Cause:** the spawned engine subprocess (piped stdio) keeps the runner's event loop alive, and
  `globalSetup`/`globalTeardown` **don't share module state** in Jest, so an in-memory process
  handle stashed at setup is `undefined` at teardown.
- **Fix:** `child.unref()` the engine once its port banner is read; record its **pid** in the
  session file and kill by pid in teardown (`taskkill /PID <pid> /T /F` on Windows, `process.kill`
  elsewhere); set Jest `forceExit: true` as a backstop. Don't rely on a `globalThis` handle across
  setup/teardown.

## JitPack doesn't pick up a new tag / example won't resolve

- **Symptom:** the example fails to resolve `com.github.antigen-labs:antigen:vX.Y`.
- **Cause:** the first resolution of a new tag triggers a JitPack build (~2 min); a cached
  failed resolution can also stick.
- **Fix:** wait for the first build; use `--refresh-dependencies`. The org is `antigen-labs`.

## `scripts/publish-tag.sh` is broken

- **Symptom:** releasing via the script misbehaves.
- **Cause:** the script is not maintained/working.
- **Fix:** never use it. Tag and push directly with `git tag vX.Y && git push origin vX.Y`
  (see the `release` skill).
